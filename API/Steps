Step 1 :To make an HTTP request to the server with JavaScript, you need an instance of an object with the necessary functionality. This is where XMLHttpRequest comes in.

            const a = new XMLHttpRequest();


Step 2 :After making a request, you will receive a response back. At this stage, you need to tell the XMLHttpRequest object which JavaScript function will handle the response, by setting the onreadystatechange property of the object to the function called when the request changes state, like this:

            function handler() {
            // Process the server response here.
            }

            httpRequest.onreadystatechange = handler;

Step 3: Next, after declaring what happens when you receive the response, you need to actually make the request, by calling the open() and send() methods of the HTTP request object, like this:

            httpRequest.open("GET", "http://www.example.org/some.file", true);
            httpRequest.send();
